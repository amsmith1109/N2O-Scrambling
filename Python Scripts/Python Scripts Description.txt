IRMS.py contains a definition for an object that stores IRMS data and is able to return ratios based on the reference gas.

Main.py is a script used to sort through the spreadsheet data and compile every dataset into a single variable, which is converted to a panda dataframe.
This is done by using a dictionary with the following hierarchy
Molecule (NO or N2O)
→Sample Canister
→→Individual Run

For the varying energy experiment they are sorted as follows
Sample Canister
→Ionization Energy
→→Individual Run

Dataframe are simply exported to a Matlab file. (Give me a break, I wasn't very proficient with Python when working on this project.)
