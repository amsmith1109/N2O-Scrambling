# N<sub>2</sub>O Scrambling Calibration


# Installation
## Requirements
Curve Fitting Toolbox (only for ```scrambleTrend```)  
Matlab R2018a or newer  

This package was only tested on R2018a. Some functions make work on previous versions, but there is no gaurantee. New versions are generally backwards compatible as new functions are added, but some may be depricated. 

## Contents
This package includes 8 files (6 functions and 2 object).

This is not an officially supported package with Matlab, so please download the files from [/src](src) folder and add them to your working directory. Files can be temporarily added by navigating to the folder with the files within Matlab, right-clicking the containing folder and selecting "Add to Path â†’ Selected Folders". 

These files can be permanently added by including the path in your settings. Select the "HOME" tab in the ribbon, then in the "ENVIRONMENT" section click on "Set Path". A dialog box opens that shows the folders currently added to Matlab's directory. Select "Add Folder..." or "Add with Subfolders...", and in the opened dialog box navigate to where the files are stored and click "Select Folder". These should not always be available whenever Matlab is started.

## N2O_Calibration_Gas

Creating the object for the reference gas(es) should be done carefully by manually entering the known contents of the reference gas. Simply enter the line:<br />
``` ref_name = N2O_Calibration_Gas```<br />
```ref_name.delta31 = delta_31_value```<br />
```ref_name.delta45 = delta_45_value```<br />
```ref_name.delta46 = delta_46_value```

It is assumed that the full isotopic description of the reference gas is known and can be derived from these three parameters, and the mass dependent fractionation of oxygen. The value for $\delta$<sup>31</sup> assumes an unscrambled ratio for <sup>31</sup>R = <sup>15</sup>R<sup>$\alpha$</sup> + <sup>17</sup>R. This object variable needs to be saved as a .mat file within the working directory of your project. The saved file will later be accessed by the related ```IsoData``` variable.

## IsoData

The purpose of the IsoData object is to have a wrapper around raw IRMS measurements. Initializing an IsoData variable stores the raw measurements and provides the functions for calculating intensity ratios r, isotopic ratios R, and the isotopic deviation values $\delta$. An example script showing how ```IsoData``` is used can be found under [/Examples/IsoData_Example.m](/Examples/IsoData_Example.m).

### Initializing IsoData variable
Raw data from an IRMS is generally a table with two sets of columns for each faraday cup measurements; one set for reference gas and another for the sample. The reported values are a measure intensity. Continuous-flow measurments are reported as integrated voltage signals (e.g., mV-s) and dual-inlet measurements are reported as an average voltage (e.g., mV). A reference gas is measured before and after the sample gas. The two measurements are averaged to give a drift corrected measurement to compare against the sample gas measurement. This software uses the raw measurements to determine the scrambling coefficient. 

```IsoData``` variables require four inputs: raw reference & sample measurements (two matricies), reference gas ID (string), and a list of the masses measured (vector). The user will need to export data from their IRMS and save it in a format that is readily interpretted by matlab (e.g., text file .txt, or comma separated values .csv).

**Example IRMS Data**
| Measurement | Reference 1 | Reference 2 | Reference 3 | Sample 1 | Sample 2 | Sample 3 |
|:----:       | :----:      | :----:      | :----:      | :----:   | :----:   | :----:   |
| pre         | 1007        | 951         | 2250        |          |          |          |
| 1           | 1005        | 950         | 2249        | 1003     | 550      | 2302     |
| 2           | 1006        | 953         | 2251        | 1002     | 545      | 2298     |
| ...         | ...         | ...         | ...         | ...      | ...      | ...      |
| 10          | 998         | 952         | 2240        | 998      | 544      | 2301     |

First read in the data and separate the reference and sample measurements. From the example table above you should have two resulting tables:

Sample = 
| Sample 1 | Sample 2 | Sample 3 |
| :----:   | :----:   | :----:   |
| 1003     | 550      | 2302     |
| 1002     | 545      | 2298     |
| ...      | ...      | ...      |
| 998      | 544      | 2301     |

Reference =
| Reference 1 | Reference 2 | Reference 3 |
| :----:      | :----:      | :----:      |
| 1007        | 951         | 2250        |
| 1005        | 950         | 2249        |
| 1006        | 953         | 2251        |
| ...         | ...         | ...         |
| 998         | 952         | 2240        |

Suppose these measurements correspond to the m/z 44, 45 and 46 measurements of a sample against a reference gas named "Nov11_2022".

```measurement = IsoData(Sample, Reference, 'Nov11-2022', [44, 45, 46])```

An alternative method is to save the relevant information into a ```struct``` variable. This requires a very specific naming structure to work properly.<br />
```samp.sample = Sample;```<br />
```samp.reference = Reference;```<br />
```sampe.refID = 'Nov11-2022';```<br />
```samp.AMU = [44, 45, 46];```

The IsoData object is not set up for storying multiple datasets in a single instance. It is up to the user for how to best organize a collection of measurments in an associated experiment. In this work, different measured for a single experiment were consolidated into a matlab struct and saved as a single .mat file (e.g., [/Data/N2O.mat](/Data/N2O.mat)).

```IsoData``` is then initialized with:

```measurement = IsoData(samp);```

Instances of ```IsoData``` objects are checked to ensure that there is always one extra line of reference measurements than sample measurements, and that the associated ```N2O_calibration_gas``` object is saved in your directory. If you get the error "[ref name] does not exist...", double check that the variable is saved as a .mat file, and add it to your working directory. Alternatively, you can use the full file path as the reference name. For exmaple, the refID field would instead be ```'C:\My Documents\Matlab\Reference Gases\Nov11_2022.mat'```. A tradeoff with using the file path is that it will only work on a single machine where the file is stored.

### IsoData Functions
Each function takes an index argument and returns the measured value and the measurement uncertainty. The index is typically either 1 or 2. For m/z [44, 45, 46], index 1 yields the associatd 45 value and index 2 yields the associated 46 value. For m/z [30, 31, 32], 1 yields the 31 value, and 2 defaults to return a 0. r: calculates the intensity ratio based on the index called. R: calculates the isotopic ratio based on the intensity ratio r, and the known isotopic composition of the reference gas. delta: calculates the isotopic compositions deviation from the accepted international standard. Depends on R and hidden properties in the reference gas. These are called in either a functional form, or as a structure call:

Functional form:<br />
```r(measurement, 1)``` = <sup>45</sup>r<br />
```R(measurement, 2)``` = <sup>46</sup>R<br />
```delta(measurement, 1)``` = <sup>45</sup>$\delta$

Structure form:<br />
```measurement.r(1)``` = <sup>45</sup>r<br />
```measurement.R(2)``` = <sup>46</sup>R<br />
```measurement.delta(1)``` = <sup>45</sup>$\delta$

## measureScrambling
(placeholder)  
Function that computes the scrambling coefficient from a given set of measurements. This uses the root-finding method to determine the scrambling coefficient that explains the measured values for known isotopic ratios of the sample and reference gas. Additional inputs are available for double substituted species. This was added as it was found the the definitions of individual isotopic ratios do not always agree when considering double substitutions.

The doubles substitution correction can be used in different ways. If no correction is provided for the double substituted species are assumed to be zero. Using a simple "true" input will cause the double substituted species to be calculated from the individual isotopic  ratios (i.e., N15_alpha, N15_beta, O17 and O18).

This function can return a vector output if a matrix of measurement values are given. However, it is restricted to a single gas as it expects a single line that describes that known ratios of the sample and reference gas.


## scrambleTrend
(placeholder)  
This function calculates an s-curve best fit line on the input x and y data. It is used to determine how scrambling varies with a given input parameter (i.e., signal intensity). This function uses the aggregate of Scrambling values determined from raw calibration measurements that were analyzed with the measureScrambling function.

## rMeasure
Calculates <sup>15</sup>R<sub>$\alpha$</sub>, <sup>15</sup>R<sub>$\beta$</sub>, <sup>17</sup>R and <sup>18</sup>R using the formulation of  <sup>31</sup>R<sub>measured</sub>, <sup>45</sup>R, <sup>46</sup>R and mass-dependent fractionation of oxygen as defined in Kaiser et al 2003. Due to the non-linearity of the mass-dependent fractionation, <sup>17</sup>R is first calculated using the root-finding function ```fzero```. All other ratios are then calculated by algebraic substitutions. The four defining equations are as follows:

<sup>17</sup>R =  0.00937035 x (<sup>18</sup>R)<sup>0.516</sup>  

<sup>31</sup>R<sub>m</sub> = s<sup>15</sup>R<sub>$\beta$</sub> + 
(1 - s)<sup>15</sup>R<sub>$\alpha$</sub> + 
<sup>17</sup>R  

<sup>45</sup>R = <sup>15</sup>R<sub>$\alpha$</sub> + <sup>15</sup>R<sub>$\beta$</sub> + <sup>17</sup>R  

<sup>46</sup>R = <sup>15</sup>R<sub>$\alpha$</sub> x <sup>17</sup>R<sub>$\beta$</sub> + 
<sup>17</sup>R x (<sup>17</sup>R<sub>$\alpha$</sub> + 
<sup>17</sup>R<sub>$\beta$</sub>) + 
<sup>18</sup>R
 
Mass-dependent fractionation of oxygen gives a direct subsitution for <sup>18</sup>R in terms of <sup>17</sup>R. Using <sup>31</sup>R<sub>m</sub> and <sup>45</sup>R, <sup>15</sup>R<sub>$\alpha$</sub> and <sup>15</sup>R<sub>$\beta$</sub> can be solved in terms of the unknown <sup>17</sup>R:

<sup>15</sup>R<sub>$\alpha$</sub>(<sup>17</sup>R, <sup>31</sup>R<sub>m</sub>, <sup>45</sup>R) 
= (1 - 2s)<sup>-1</sup> x (<sup>31</sup>R - s<sup>45</sup>R - (1-s)<sup>17</sup>R)  
<sup>15</sup>R<sub>$\beta$</sub>(<sup>17</sup>R, <sup>31</sup>R<sub>m</sub>, <sup>45</sup>R) 
= (1 - 2s)<sup>-1</sup> x ((1-s)<sup>45</sup>R - <sup>31</sup>R - s<sup>17</sup>R)

This leads to an expression for <sup>46</sup>R that is given in terms of the measured quantities <sup>31</sup>R<sub>m</sub>, <sup>45</sup>R and the unknown <sup>17</sup>R. The quantity for <sup>17</sup>R is then determined by applying the root-finding algorithm to the difference between the measured value of <sup>46</sup>R and the expression for <sup>46</sup>R that depends on <sup>31</sup>R<sub>m</sub>, <sup>45</sup>R and <sup>17</sup>R:

<sup>46</sup>R - <sub>46</sup>R(<sup>17</sup>R, <sup>31</sup>R<sub>m</sub>, <sup>45</sup>R) = 0

With the resulting quantity of <sup>17</sup>R, <sup>18</sup>R, <sup>15</sup>R<sub>$\alpha$</sub>, and <sup>15</sup>R<sub>$\beta$</sub> are calculated. 

## invRM
This function inverses the quantities from ```rMeasure``` using the same formulation:

<sup>17</sup>R =  0.00937035 x (<sup>18</sup>R)<sup>0.516</sup>  
<sup>31</sup>R<sub>m</sub> = s<sup>15</sup>R<sub>$\beta$</sub> +
 (1 - s)<sup>15</sup>R<sub>$\alpha$</sub> +
 <sup>17</sup>R  
<sup>45</sup>R = <sup>15</sup>R<sub>$\alpha$</sub> + <sup>15</sup>R<sub>$\beta$</sub> + <sup>17</sup>R  
<sup>46</sup>R = <sup>15</sup>R<sub>$\alpha$</sub> x <sup>17</sup>R<sub>$\beta$</sub> +
 <sup>17</sup>R x (<sup>17</sup>R<sub>$\alpha$</sub> +
 <sup>17</sup>R<sub>$\beta$</sub>) +
 <sup>18</sup>R


# Workflow
The workflow described here only describes the analysis process for determining the scrambling coefficient that is later used to determine isotopomer ratios for an N<sub>2</sub>O sample. Measurement techniques may vary from machine to machine. 

Processing data is a linear process that can be scripted (see examples). The general process is: import data â†’ calculate scrambling â†’ evaluate trend.

## Importing Data and Creating Objects
This code uses defined objects as wrappers for data. This ensures consistency in code execution and some convenience for easily extracting properties from raw data. The two defined data objects are ```N2O_Calibration_Gas``` and ```IsoData```.
